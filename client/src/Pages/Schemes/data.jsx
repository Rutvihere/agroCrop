        desc:`<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an approach to pest control and management that focuses on using a combination of preventive measures, biological controls, cultural practices, and targeted use of pesticides to minimize the impact of pests while ensuring the health and sustainability of ecosystems.
<ul>
    The key principles of Integrated Pest Management include:

<li>Pest Identification: Accurately identifying the pest species and understanding its biology and behavior is crucial in developing effective control strategies.</li>

    <li>Monitoring and Scouting: Regular monitoring and scouting are carried out to assess pest populations and determine if intervention is necessary. This may involve using traps, visual inspections, or other techniques.</li>

        <li>Prevention: Emphasis is placed on preventing pest infestations through practices such as crop rotation, proper sanitation, good hygiene, and exclusion methods. Creating unfavorable conditions for pests reduces their chances of establishing and spreading.</li>

            <li>Biological Controls: Encouraging natural enemies of pests, such as predators, parasitoids, and beneficial insects, is an important aspect of IPM. These natural enemies help to keep pest populations in check.</li>

                <li>Cultural Controls: Modifying cultural practices can help manage pests. This may involve adjusting planting dates, selecting pest-resistant plant varieties, optimizing irrigation and fertilization practices, and maintaining overall plant health.</li>

                    <li>Mechanical and Physical Controls: Mechanical and physical methods, such as traps, barriers, mulching, and hand-picking, can be used to physically remove pests or create obstacles to their entry or feeding.</li>

                        <li>Chemical Controls as a Last Resort: If non-chemical methods are insufficient, judicious and targeted use of pesticides may be considered. However, pesticides are used as a last resort and are chosen based on their effectiveness, target specificity, and minimal impact on beneficial organisms and the environment.</li></p>`

            <li>Market Linkages: The mission recognizes the importance of market access and fair prices for farmers. It
                supports the establishment of market infrastructure, value addition, and market linkages to enhance
                farmers' incomes and promote sustainable agricultural livelihoods.</li>

            <li> Climate Resilient Practices: Given the increasing vulnerability of agriculture to climate change
                impacts, the NMSA focuses on promoting climate-resilient practices such as crop diversification,
                agroforestry, and agroecology to enhance farmers' adaptive capacity.</li>

            <li> Research and Development: The mission emphasizes research and development activities to generate
                knowledge, innovation, and technologies for sustainable agriculture. It supports collaborative research
                efforts and the dissemination of research findings to stakeholders</li>
